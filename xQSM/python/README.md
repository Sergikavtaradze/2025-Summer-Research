## For quick demo/evaluation of our network
Please directly use command '**python run_demo.py**' or '**run_demo.ipynb**'  provided in '**eval**' folder. It is recommended GPU (10 GB memory larger for xQSM and 15GB memory larger for Unet) should be used for network inference because pytorch did not provide optimized calculation for the nets on CPU; 

## To train a new xQSM network based on your data
To be uploaded shortly.
